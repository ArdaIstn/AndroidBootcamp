# Sign Up Page Example
---

## This is a sign up page using Constraint Layout.In this project,I used google fonts to download key and mail icons.Also I learned how to implement icons in editText.Also I used basic concepts of Constraint Layout such as chains and center.I used color and string  values files to avoid repeated use.Lastly, I created a Shape xml file in Drawable. I used this xml file to change the shape of the buttons.
